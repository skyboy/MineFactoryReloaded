MineFactory Reloaded
=============

MineFactory Reloaded is a mod created by PowerCrystals that adds numerous machines into the game as well as some new items, a new type of Rubber Tree, and the Precision Sledgehammer (a new type of tool for manipulating blocks similar to the Wrench and other miscellaneous things).

Compiling
=======

You will need Apache Ant and Git.

Run: git clone https://github.com/skyboy/MineFactoryReloaded.git; && cd MineFactoryReloaded

It should download the repository and cd into the repository.

Next, run: ant

It should find the Buildfile and start downloading Forge and MCP.

It will start decompiling Minecraft and then after a few minutes there should be 3 files, 'MFR-API-\[VERSION\]-CUSTOM_BUILD.zip', 'MineFactoryReloaded-\[VERSION\]-CUSTOM_BUILD.jar', and 'MineFactoryReloaded-\[VERSION\]-dev-CUSTOM_BUILD.jar'  in build/dist/. Those are the compiled versions of MineFactory Reloaded.

Free for non-commercial use. You are free to include any of these mods in any modpacks or server-specific packs without needing to ask permission (but it'd be nice to hear if you do!), provided something either in the download or on your site lists me as the creator. You are also free to produce Bukkit ports. A link to [this thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2016680-162164-powercrystals-mods-minefactoryreloaded-powercrystalscore-and-netherores-updated-mfr-275-released/) would be nice for any of the above, but that's all I ask.

You also have implied permission to build mods that depend on PowerCrystalsCore, if you want some of the functionality in there.
